# Required Status Checks

Enable [required status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-required-status-checks/) if you want to enforce the DCO on all commits (you will need to open at least one Pull Request after configuring the integration before you can set this up).

Now pushes to `master` will not be allowed, and all pull requests must pass the DCO checks before being merged.
